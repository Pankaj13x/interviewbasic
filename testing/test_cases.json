I think that one of the reasons I'm into open phones is it's a way of getting all this information. The parallels between the podcast and open phones is a bit tangent are, how do you make sense of all this information? The world has an in a thoughtful way. And I like those types of problems. But to answer the question, I'm not sure I'd like to get that MVP and see if I have product market fit. When a good part of it I'm doing it's also just part of the job search. It is helping me learn skills and just communicate my value externally beyond just representing myself on Zoom. So when I get a full month's Alisher, but it's been a good learning so far.",
